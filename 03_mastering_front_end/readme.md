## Overview

For your first project, you're going to build a **professional website!**
What kind of website will this be? That's up to you! We will need to *approve* your website before moving forward.

#### What should your website focus on....?
- An imaginary business?
- A charity or non-profit group?
- A website for a product?
- Your personal brand/contact me page?
- An event website? Perhaps a wedding RSVP site?

#### Project Hosting
This first project should be hosted on your Github pages account under the `project1` resource/sub-directory. (http://your-username.github.io/project1). This will be in your Github pages repository (such as https://github.com/code-for-coffee/code-for-coffee.github.io). We will make exceptions for students who choose to host their application on their own server; however, we will not be able to assist with non Github-pages resources until we cover them in class (we discuss server hosting in the coming weeks).

### Technical Requirements

Your website must must:

* **Be hosted on Github Pages and be available to the web**
* **Contain an organization structure for HTML, CSS, and Javascript**
* **Utilize vanilla Javascript OR jQuery for DOM manipulation**
* **Adequately represent your project scope**; ie: a product website should contain product information.
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **TWO media queries/breakpoints** for **Responsive Design**
* Use **ONE `$.ajax` calls to external APIs** and **render data** from them

#### Bonus Requirements
* **Include a Contact Form** that works in real-time!
* **Include a Google Map** on you website to show the location of the service(s) provided
* Include multiple pages that follow the same design/layout as others
* Use **Sass** in your project for CSS variables, nesting, and more!\
* Use **jQuery Animations** or **CSS Key Frames** to make your page come to life!

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working professional website, built by you**, hosted on Github Pages
* A **link to your hosted working website** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted website, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.


### Some Suggestions from the GA Team

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your website each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. 

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **1** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **2** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
