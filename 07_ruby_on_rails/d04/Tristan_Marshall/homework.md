###Notes:
* I had trouble getting bootstrap functional. I copied the library into home.scss, tried adding the gem. I'm sure I missed something obvious.

* I was able to meet very minimal requirements of assignment due to lack of time, Although I would like to say following along on the videos and is extremely helpful. Its very hard for me to imagine myself memorizing all of those steps as there are so so many.

* Here is picture of a mouse playing the saxaphone.
