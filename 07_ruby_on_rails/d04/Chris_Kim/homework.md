I created a Recipe App.  I followed a walkthrough I found on the web, which helped tremendously, but I also learned a lot from this exercise.  In particular, I learned how to implement the Devise gem to build the user authentication/security for the application, as well as a number of new features, including how to create associations for multiple models in Active Record, and how to build partial views for nested forms.
