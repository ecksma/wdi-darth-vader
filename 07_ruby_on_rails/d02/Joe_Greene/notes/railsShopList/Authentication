We have to lock this down so we wont get hacked!
1)first create a users table
go to gem file uncoment out gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'
Bundle
rails g model user name email password_digest
rake db:migrate
create a controller that lets me sign up users
rails g controller users new create
go to routes.rb

go to user.rb
has_secure_password

go to users_controller.rb
#render a view to signup
#create some user and such

Why u need comments
(six months from now why you did what you did)

go to new.html.erb
h2
dif way 'users/create'

then we did
<%= form_for :user, url: 'users/create' do |f| %>

Name: <%= f.text_field :name %>
Email <%= f.text_field :email %>
Password <%= f.password_field :password %>
Confirm Password <%= f.password_field :password_confirmation %>
<%= f.submit 'Register Now!' %>

<% end %>



Go to Users controllers
private functions classes

social security is

if we post an account and no User when register, there is a prob
only the user controller or cares about users
shopplist only cares about the list

params you must have a user with these things

in users controller

  def create
    #create some user and such
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    if @user.save
      session[:user_id] = @user.id
      redirect_to '/home'
    else
      redirect_to '/users/signup'
    end

  end

  private
  # everything after private is private
  #only owned by this controller

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name,:email,:password,:password_confirmation)

    changed new to users/signup
