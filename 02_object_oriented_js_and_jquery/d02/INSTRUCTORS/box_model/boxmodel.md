Lesson Opening
YAY TEAM GA! We love each other, look how close we are! Not always want to be here together at space though.

	Obj. #1 The Box Model is a combination of HTML and CSS. Each HTML element represents a rectangular box on the page.
	Obj. #2 Made up of content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge. (Use diagram)
	Obj. #3 We use CSS to determine the values or spacing of these values.
Obj. 4 Use DevTools to help show boxes.


Intro to new Material
I do.
Show HTML and CSS of TEAM GA page
Content - can be text, image, etc. Show edge of content (picture)
Border - give everyone a "home" with different color and thickness of borders in css. Ask for input for participation.
Margin - everyone's home isn't right next to each other's. Some guys live in the burbs with a lot of space between houses (or boxes), some guys in RN or the loop right next to other people's condo (or boxes).  Get class input for who lives where.
Padding - similar to how some guys have more space outside of the homes between other homes. Some guys just have bigger places with more room to spread out and not feel cramped. This Padding occurs inside the border  or their house  giving room for the content (show content edge). Give Tera a small place because he's a rookie.

Quickly go through each person's house, where it is, and how big it is. Using DevTools
Show how to open DevTools - option, cmd, I
	Inspect Element - 2 finger click (right click) - on element want to get info for
	Show where styles is in DevTools
	Highlight Box Model attributes. Show each of the pictures & boxes.


Fist to five of understanding. Ask for difference between margin and padding. Tell everyone to open dev tools and inspect one picture.


Guided Practice
We do.
Do the same thing with text instead of images, using our names. Code along. Will need to make a new HTML doc, new CSS doc, and link the 2. Ask for input of colors and city or burbs from each person while they are coding along. Ask a random person how they'll give themselves more space, or padding in their house.

Use Dev Tools to confirm margin, border, & padding values.

Fist to Five.


Independent Exercise
You do.
Get 3 to 5 pictures of a group of people, houses or anything else related, and give them all the margin, border and padding that is appropriate for each of them. Remember need an HTML doc, a CSS doc, and then link the CSS doc to the HTML doc.

Use DevTools to confirm your CSS code.
Share your box model styling in Slack!


Lesson Closing
Bring back the Hawks for the parade quickly eliminating borders and padding while asking how, but give a small margin so that they aren't hugging each other as much anymore. The love is there, but a little more subdued. Who needs a little more margin? Make a new div with a border that is the bus.
Cover learning objectives again as it's done.

Obj. #1 The Box Model is a combination of HTML and CSS. Each HTML element represents a rectangular box on the page.
Obj. #2 Made up of content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge. (Use diagram)
Obj. #3 We use CSS to determine the values or spacing of these values.
Obj. #4 Use DevTools to help show boxes.

Ask a few questions how to change margin, border, padding, give hints if needed based on relatable examples.

Now we can give elements spacing, and can start to learn dynamic ways to position those elements.
