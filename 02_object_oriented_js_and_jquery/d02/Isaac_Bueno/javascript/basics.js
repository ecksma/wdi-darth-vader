Define and give 3 examples of each of these JavaScript terms. Don't be afraid to search google, MDN, or any other resource you want to use. If the term is an object, include that in the definition.

Object- An object is an object. It is the thing that we give attributes and abilities. Object refers to a data structure containing data and instructions for working with the data.
Var _______ ={}
Number (including integers and floating point numbers)- Number's dont have strings.
1,2,3
[1,2,3]

String- A string is always in " ". A string can be in an array, in an alert, a console.log, etc
["isaac"],
alert("isaac"),
console.log("isaac")

String Concatenation- string Concatenation is a series of connections that go between variables, "strings" and are connected by +
"string concatenation" + " " + "in its simplest form" + " " + "looks like this!"

*what is parseint, and how is it used?*
The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).
var num1= prompt('Give me a number') //5
num1 //prints
5
parseInt("5 guys burgers")
5
Boolean- A boolean is given a certain value which relays whether something is true or false, or "truthy" and "falsey"
&&
||
!

Modulus- Modulus (%) operator returns only the remainder. If either value is a string, an attempt is made to convert the string to a number.
var resultOfMod = 26 % 3;
 7 % 2;


Array- an array is a series of numbers and or strings which are held inside of [ ]
["isaac" , 1, "bueno", 2]
["numberone", 1]

Variable- A variable is a named location for storing a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.
var isaacBueno;
var x;

property- A property is a characteristic of an object, often describing attributes associated with a data structure. It exists to kind of properties: an Instance Property which holds data specific to a given object instance, or a Static Property which holds data shared between all object instances.
A property is an attribute

//var isaac = {
  isaac.age <-- this is a property
//}


method-A method is a function which is a property of an object. Owned by an object.

zip-up

conditional statement- Conditional statements are the set of commands used to perform different actions based on different conditions. JavaScript supports two conditional statements: if...else and switch. Both perform in saw way the same task.

if (condition) {
   statements_1
} else {
   statements_2
}
