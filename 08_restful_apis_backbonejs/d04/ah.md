## Models After Hours


#### Build a model!

* In `08.../d04/you_name`, create a new file called fun_with_models.js
* Open fun_with_models.js in atom.
Search the internet for an API that you can retrieve information from.
* Create a Backbone.js model inside of your file.
* Instantiate a new model.
* Give it a url.
* fetch() the data.
* Console log out your model's attributes

#### Thinking About Collections

* In a markdown file (inside of `08.../d04/you_name`) called `thinking_models.md`...
* Write out how you would build a list of models
* Be creative!
* Brainstorm and have fun! :)
