## What the $@&% do I need for a Sinatra app?

- Computers closed.
- Use a piece of graph paper to write down the files needed for a basic Sinatra app.
- Include the basic code needed for each file including a root route with a hash to display info via json.

## How fast are you?
- With your computer now, build a basic Sinatra app

- Do it again, faster

- And again, FASTER

## It's time to race!
- Based on the offical tournament bracket [Bracket Here](http://challonge.com/tournaments/bracket_generator?ref=k3kI1eSxjr), we're racing to see who the fastest in the class is to build a WORKING basic Sinatra app.

- I'll say go, then the winner should raise their hand. If there's a dispute who the winner is, I'll settle it. The top 3 in the class will win a free **(non-alcoholic)**drink on Tom.
