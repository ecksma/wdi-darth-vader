# 1. Write a function lengths that accepts a single parameter as an argument, namely an array of strings. The function should return an array of numbers. Each number in the array should be the length of the corresponding string.

cloths =['shirt', 'tie', 'pants', 'hat', 'socks']
for i in cloths
  puts i
end



# Write a Ruby function called transmogrifier This function should accept three arguments, which you can assume will be numbers. Your function should return the "transmogrified" result
# The transmogrified result of three numbers is the product (numbers multiplied together) of the first two numbers, raised to the power (exponentially) of the third number.
# For example, the transmogrified result of 5, 3, and 2 is (5 times 3) to the power of 2 is 225.
# Use your function to find the following answers.

# transmogrifier(5, 4, 3)
# transmogrifier(13, 12, 5)
# transmogrifier(42, 13, 7)
