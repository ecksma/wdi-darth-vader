##Ruby Review


1. Write 2 arrays, one that contains the names for everyone wearing a Hawaiian shirt, and one for everyone who is not.

2. Remove the last person from each array

3. Add a new person to each array

4. Iterate through each array using .each and .map and console.log() each item.

5. Write a Class (must take in at least 3 arguments and contain a to_s) for at least one array and instantiate a new instance of each item in the array
