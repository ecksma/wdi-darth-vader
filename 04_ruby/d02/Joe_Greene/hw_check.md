Define (in your own words) what a Class is

In Ruby language, a class is a way to blueprint/make Objects. A class is an object too and can inherit properties from another class.

Define why getters/setters are important

Getters/setters are important for setting and pulling values. This is important especially when pulling data from other sources (fetching). You can also be lazy and not have to type repetitive code. It is similar to having a template and you are just creating/modifying (setting) the values.

Describe inheritance between Objects/Classes in your own words

Inheritance between Objects and Classes can be hard to explain, but doesn't have to be. Everything in Ruby is an Object. In Ruby, classes can only inherit from one object. We did a great alternative version of the alphabet game where person1 with letter A gives to person2 who has B the letter A as well. Person3 with letter C will get A and B. This is the best way I can explain it in my head.

Describe why splat args can be powerful when used as the argument in a method

I understand splat args are used when you don't know how many arguments you have. It works similar to javascript function's array argument.
