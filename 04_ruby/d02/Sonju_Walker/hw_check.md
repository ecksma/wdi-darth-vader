1.  Define (in your own words) what a Class is
  **Class** is a blueprint of attributes related to any Object.

* Define why getters/setters are important.
  **Setter** defines the Object's class/attributes. **Getter** creates a method to retrieve the class or attributes. Its important because you won't repeat your code.  

* Describe inheritance between Objects/Classes in your own words.
**Inheritance** enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects.  

  *If a relationship does not exist between a subclass and superclass, you should not use inheritance.*

* Describe why *args can be powerful when used as the argument in a method.

 Also, known as **SPLAT** function which you can pass multiple arguments through. Use if you don't know how long your string will be.
