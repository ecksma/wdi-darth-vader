#Homework Week 4 Day 2

1. What is a class?

...A class in Ruby is like an object constructor in Javascript. Writing a class and assigning attributes and abilities allows you to instantiate new instances of the class.

2. Why are getters/setters important?

...Getters and setters are important because they allow you to "teach" the program how to manipulate specific classes and variables. You can set instance variables that can only be accessed and used within the class.

3. Inheritance between classes/objects
In Ruby, a class can only inherit from a single other class. A class will inherit all attributes and abilities from it's parent class, but it can also overwrite those and add attributes/abilities of it's own. If the modified class becomes the parent of another class then that class inherits the modified version, or abilities/attributes from the grandparent class if they are still intact.

4. Why are \*Args powerful?

...\*Args can be powerful when used as an argument in a method because that means you can pass any number of aruguments within the method.
