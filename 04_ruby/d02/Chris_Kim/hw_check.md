***Check for Understanding***

- **Define (in your own words) what a Class is**
  - A class is a unique data structure that forms the blueprint for the objects that are created from it.


- **Define why getters/setters are important**
  - These functions are important because only the objects methods can access the instance variables (which only exist within the scope of the class).  Setter methods allow you to assign a value in memory for access using a getter method.


- **Describe inheritance between Objects/Classes in your own words**
  - Inheritance means that an objects created out a class (blueprint) has access to the methods of the class.  Any additional methods that are created are received by the child/offspring, but inheritance of the methods only moves downstream.


- **Describe why *args can be powerful when used as the argument in a method**
-   The Splat! * symbol can be powerful because it creates an empty array of arguments that are passed into the function.  It organizes the data into a systemic structure that can be accessed and manipulated.
