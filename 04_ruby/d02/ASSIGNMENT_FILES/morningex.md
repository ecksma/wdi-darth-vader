#Construction Junction

###In week 4, Day 2, your_name directory create a ninja.js file

###Create Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Objects with their name, color, weapon, and favorite saying

###Use a Constructor Function to create a new TMNT

#### If you need to refer back, we have done this EXACT exercise already in class! (the weeks go by so fast... but week 2 is a great place to start)
