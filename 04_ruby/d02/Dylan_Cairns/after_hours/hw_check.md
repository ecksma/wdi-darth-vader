#Class
A class is a blueprint for individual objects 

##Getters and Setters
Getters return the value of an instance variable that would otherwise not be accessable 
Setters allow you to set the value of an instance a class 

##Inheritence 
Inheritence allows classes to inherit methods and variables from other classes. Classes cannot inherit from multiple classes like a branch but they can  in a straight line from their parent and grandparent. 

##Args
args an be powerful because it allows you to handle every argument passed in even if you weren't necessarily expecting it. It's also very easy to enumerate through these arguments with `each`
