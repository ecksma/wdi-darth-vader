####Define what a class is.

A class is an object that is used as a blueprint for creating objects that have similar attributes and methods.  When we create a class, we initialize it with attributes and associate methods.  Then when we create a new object using that class, the object will be initialized with the attributes and have the ability to use the methods associated to the class.


####Define why getters/setters are important.

Getters and setters are important, because they allow us to restrict access to the attributes and methods of a class/object.  The only way to set attributes for an object is using the setters and the only  way to get attributes and use methods is the getters.

####Describe inheritance between Objects/Classes in your own words.

Inheritance in Ruby between Objects/Classes is singular and only from 'parent' to 'child'.  This means that if an object/class has multiple 'ancestors' then those attributes and methods can continue to be be passed(inherited) down the chain.

####Describe why \*args can be powerful when used as the argument in a method.

\*args can be powerful because they allow us to any any number of arguments with needing to specify them upfront.
