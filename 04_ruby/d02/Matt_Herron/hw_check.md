##Define (in your own words) what a Class is
A class is a feature of object oriented programming languages that allows the developer to create blueprints of their own objects that either define attributes and abilities entirely within the class or inherit from another class.  Instances of the class are 'instantiated' in the form of Objects that can be used to process and data and run routines on the server (or any computer)

##Define why getters/setters are important
Getters and Setters are the best way to allow the users of your class to create or change the data in the insatnce variables of the class or to simply get them out of the current state of the object for processing from within their program

##Describe inheritance between Objects/Classes in your own words
Classes typically define a set of their own attributes and abilities.  However, in addition to defining their own set of attributes and abilities, classes can be set to inherit attributes and abilities from other classes which makes it easy to extend the functionality of any given class.

##Describe why *args can be powerful when used as the argument in a method
*args are very powerful.  They allow for the method writer (programmer) to have their method allow for a variable number of arguments.  This is great when it isn't known how many arguments are needed from the user.
