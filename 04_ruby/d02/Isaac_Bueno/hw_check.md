Finally, in a new file called hw_check.md (a Markdown file, not Ruby!)...
Define (in your own words) what a Class is
Define why getters/setters are important
Describe inheritance between Objects/Classes in your own words
Describe why args can be powerful when used as the argument in a method


- A Class holds arguments so that you dont have to type the same lines of code OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
It allows the developer to be able to run the same line of code asking to place new values in the
assigned arguments.

- I didn't quite understand why getter and setters were important until Marion showed me that you can set a value
because it gives you a blueprint of information that brings data in
you can either get it or set it. It allows you to pull in other data from other sources.

- inheretance between objects/classes are arguments that are being passed down from one class or object to another.

- args allows you to use multiple arguments.....mainly when you dont know how many arguements you're going to have
